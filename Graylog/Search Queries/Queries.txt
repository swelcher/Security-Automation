# A quick way to identify rogue svchost processes is to perform consecutive queries. As of right now, there is not a way to
# dynamically set variables based on specific search queries so we have to perform multiple queries.
# Within our un-altered pslist stream, we can perform a query such as:
Name:services.exe

# We will now place an inverse query for all the PID's of the services.exe values into a OR query for the PPID field to
# look like:
NOT PPID:(464 848 484)

# The values 464, 848, and 484 are obviously just place holders for whatever the value of the services.exe PID values are
# set to currently.
# If there are any svchost.exe's or taskhost.exe's listed, these should be further inspected.
