# This rule is created to extract the IP address of the remote IP address from the Netscan plugin. Once the extraction
# has been performed, a lookup to Alienvaults Open Threat Exchang is performed and if the IP address has been previously
# associated with malicious activity, a field labeled "IPAddress_threat_indicated" is created and a True value is set.
# If no malicious activity has been previously related to that IP address, then the "IPAddress_threat_indicated" field
# is set to false.
