# I will create a stream for Snort alerts that are identifying communication to Blacklisted IP addresses. The reason I create this pipeline
# is if a Snort sensor is monitoring traffic outside of a firewall, this can be quite noisy, so by identifying the internal networks
# you can trigger this alert only when an endpoint within the network communicates with a Blacklisted IP.
