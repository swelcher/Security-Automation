-Keep indices between 20-50GB
-One shard per instance
-Prefer to maintain 3+ in a cluster
-ALLOCATE ENOUGH SPACE
-local monitoring
-Assign half ram to java heap, but don't go over 32GB
-Avoid swap
-Rotate indices by days
-Firewalls will contribute a majority of the traffic
-Not Uncommon for Firewalls to account for 50%-75%+ of data which can help when determining how to size instance
